\begin{abstract}
Structure editors allow programmers to edit the tree structure of a program directly.
They can provide cognitive benefits for novice programmers, simplify language composition, 
and improve the availability of editor services. They are also known for being hard 
to use.

We present the structure editor design of \Hazel, a live functional programming
environment. \Hazel's type-aware edit actions and execution semantics for incomplete programs ensure that every reachable edit state is not only syntactically well-formed, but also statically and dynamically well-defined. This unique invariant of \Hazel adds new motivation to improve the ergonomics of structure editing. 

In our effort to do so, we incorporate a novel \emph{delimited selection mode} to resolve ambiguous user intent when wrapping and unwrapping parent nodes around their children. Just as code completion menus facilitate exploration of valid token completions, delimited selection mode facilitates exploration of valid placements of a syntactic delimiter. It also makes it easy to preserve children nodes when removing their parent. We motivate and describe our design choices, compare our design to prior work, and describe our plan for user evaluation.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item pros of structure editing
		\begin{itemize}
			\item cognitive benefits for novices, e.g., Scratch
			\item language composition, e.g., MPS/mbeddr
			\item true liveness, e.g., \Hazel
		\end{itemize}
	\item yet not widely adopted
		\begin{itemize}
			\item tool integration
			\item usability
			\item in this paper, we focus on usability
		\end{itemize}
	\item prior work on improving usability for inputting sequences of infix operators
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item early structure editors like Cornell Synthesizer stepped around issue of infix operator sequences by resorting to text editing at leaves
  		\item other editors leverage a form of online precedence parsing to restructure the tree as needed
  	\end{itemize}
	\item comparatively, little innovation on interface for complex node construction and removal, that is, creating a new node that wraps around existing code, and removing a node while preserving or moving its children
		\begin{itemize}
			\item we believe interface for such operations in today's structure editors is key contributor to users' negative perceptions of structure editing
		\end{itemize}
	\item in a controlled experiment comparing user efficiency for MPS vs a text editor, Berger et al.~\todo{cite} observe that novice users of structure editors perceive selection as inaccurate compared to other operations, and that \emph{both} novice and proficient users of structure editors perceive deletion as inaccurate compared to other operations.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item responses to a post-survey questionnaire reveal that structure editor users felt that they often deleted more than they expected, motivating our desire for a better interface for complex deletions
		\end{itemize}
	\item meanwhile, selection is essential for node construction in existing structure editors
		\begin{itemize}
			\item either the user must select a child node before applying a construction operation or the user must create the node and then select and move existing nodes into it
			\item thus, usability issues for selection affect node construction as well
		\end{itemize}
	\item additionally, we conjecture that node construction is awkward for novice users of structure editors because it inverts the usual order of operations when constructing nodes in text editors

\section{Design} \label{sec:example}

\subsection{Example}

We begin with an example-driven overview of \Hazel's editing mechanics.
We walk through how one might implement in \Hazel the function \texttt{str\_of\_list},
which takes a list of numbers and returns its string representation. We
elide most steps and focus on a few interesting edit transitions.

In the rest of this section, each consecutive pair of programs connected
visually by a line represents a single edit transition. Text between the
start and end state of each edit describes the edit and relevant features of
\Hazel. Elided steps are denoted by ellipses between pairs of programs.
\todo{add mention of cursor inspector, other editor services we are omitting
to focus on editing mechanics}

\noindent
\begin{hazel}
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	We begin with an empty expression hole.
	\textcolor{red}{(Add something here about expression holes.)}
	\textcolor{red}{(Also something about the text-like cursor.)}
	We would first like to define a variable \texttt{str\_of\_list}, so we begin typing out the keyword
	\texttt{let}. 
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
<c>le</c>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	As we type, the editor identifies \texttt{le} as an unbound variable and indicates this
	fact with an orange dotted border.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
<c>let</c>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	Upon typing out the reserved keyword \texttt{let}, indicated by the bold font, we invoke
	construction of a let line by hitting Space.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let <c>_</c> = <h>_</h> in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\[\vdots\]
\begin{hazel}
let <c>str_of_lst</c> = <h>_</h> in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	Upon typing out the function name, we hit the Tab key to move our cursor to the next empty hole.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = <c>_</c> in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	We use Backslash to create a lambda expression.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = @\lam @<c>_</c>.{<h>_</h>} in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\[\vdots\]
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = @\lam @ns.{<c>case</c>} in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	Like \texttt{let}, \texttt{case} is a reserved keyword and can be used to construct
	a case expression by hitting Space after typing out the word.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		case <c>_</c>
		| <h>_</h> @\casearrow @ <h>_</h> |
		end
	}
in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\[\vdots\]
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		case ns
		| [] @\casearrow @ <c>""</c>
		end
	}
in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	Pressing Enter at the end of a \texttt{case} rule creates a new rule.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		case ns
		| [] @\casearrow @ ""
		| <c>_</c>  @\casearrow @ <h>_</h>
		end
	}
in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\[\vdots\]
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		case ns
		| []      @\casearrow @ ""
		| n :: [] @\casearrow @ <c>str_of_int</c>
		end
	}
in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	Suppose we have the function \texttt{str\_of\_int} in scope.
	As we fill out the second rule, we encounter a type inconsistency,
	denoted by the red dotted border around \texttt{str\_of\_int} on
	Line 5. \Hazel expects the rule to have a return type of \texttt{String}
	but it has found a value of type \texttt{Num \fnarrow~String} instead.
	The type inconsistency is resolved once we hit Space to construct
	a function application.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		case ns
		| []      @\casearrow @ ""
		| n :: [] @\casearrow @ str_of_int <c>_</c>
		end
	}
in
<h>_</h>
\end{hazel}
	\[\vdots\]
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		case ns
		| []      @\casearrow @ ""
		| n :: [] @\casearrow @ str_of_int n		
		| n :: ns @\casearrow @ str_of_int n ++ "," ++ str_of_lst ns
		end
	}
in
<c>_</c>
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	At this point, we realize that we would like bookend the return string
	with brackets. This requires refactoring the current body of
	\texttt{str\_of\_lst} into its own internal recursive helper function.
	We add a new line above the \texttt{case} expression and create a
	\texttt{let} line.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		let <h>_</h> = <h>_</h> [in]
		case ns
		| []      @\casearrow @ ""
		| n :: [] @\casearrow @ str_of_int n		
		| n :: ns @\casearrow @ str_of_int n ++ "," ++ str_of_lst ns
		end
	}
in
_
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	We have triggered \emph{delimited selection mode}. \Hazel has detected
	ambiguity in our intent: should the \texttt{case} expression be part of
	the defining expression of the \texttt{let} line we just constructed,
	or should it remain in the subsequent body expression? Such ambiguities
	can be reduced to ambiguity in where to place a syntactic delimiter
	of the node being constructed. In this case, the delimiter in question is
	\texttt{in} on Line 3. In delimited selection mode, the left and right
	keys cycle through viable placements of the delimiter in question.
	We want the \texttt{case} expression to be in the defining expression,
	i.e., we want the \texttt{in} delimiter to come after the \texttt{case}
	expression, so we press right to see the next viable position.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		let <h>_</h> =
			case ns
			| []      @\casearrow @ ""
			| n :: [] @\casearrow @ str_of_int n		
			| n :: ns @\casearrow @ str_of_int n ++ "," ++ str_of_lst ns
			end
		[in]
		<h>_</h>
	}
in
_
\end{hazel}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	The \texttt{case} expression has filled the empty hole previously in 
	the defining expression, and a new empty hole has been generated as the
	new body expression on Line 10.
	\end{tabular}
\begin{hazel}
let str_of_lst = 
	@\lam @ns.{
		let <h>_</h> =
			case ns
			| []      @\casearrow @ ""

		[in]
		<h>_</h>

	\begin{tabular}{|p{\linewidth}}
	This is the position we want, so we press Enter to return to
	the usual editing mode.

let str_of_lst =

guided by overall text like experience, you want to operate on a tree like structure but enable linear operations as suggested by the layout, doesn't preclude tree operations or tree affordances/signifiers
\begin{itemize}
\item text-like cursor, single point of focus, differs from POPL 17 paper
\item deletion
\item operator sequences
\item selection model + cut/copy
\item line items (linearing tree)
\item keywords
\item tabbing between holes
\item cursor inspector, what is highlighted under the cursor, what is the mapping between text cursor and semantic cursor
\item transitory edit mode
\item shifting parentheses/delimiters (mark shift points, highlight points with least errors (maybe a single highlighted suggestion to minimize clutter)?)
\item maybe swapping
\item maybe mention inlining context inspector, put live values in side of code
\end{itemize}
