\begin{abstract}
Structure editors allow programmers to edit the tree structure of a program directly.
They can provide cognitive benefits for novice programmers, simplify language composition, 
and improve the availability of editor services. They are also known for being hard 
to use.

We present the structure editor design of \Hazel, a live functional programming
environment. \Hazel's type-aware edit actions and execution semantics for incomplete programs ensure that every reachable edit state is not only syntactically well-formed, but also statically and dynamically well-defined. This unique invariant of \Hazel adds new motivation to improve the ergonomics of structure editing. 

In our effort to do so, we incorporate a novel \emph{node staging} mode to resolve ambiguous user intent when wrapping and unwrapping parent nodes around their children. Just as code completion menus facilitate exploration of valid token completions, node staging facilitates exploration of valid placements of a node's syntactic delimiters. It also makes it easy to preserve children nodes when removing their parent. We motivate and describe our design choices, compare our design to prior work, and describe our plan for user evaluation.

\section{Introduction}
Plain text dominates as the universal format for computer programs. Although the simplicity and generality of text are extremely useful, the benefits come at 
some costs. For novice programmers, the 
unrestricted nature of text leaves room for syntax errors that make learning how to program 
more difficult \cite{text_vs_frame}. Plain text also
complicates the design of language-aware editor services. Because many sequences of 
characters do not correspond to meaningful programs, these services flicker in and out of 
availability, or their implementations must deploy \emph{ad hoc} heuristics, e.g., by using 
whitespace to guess intent 
\cite{error_recovery_generated_parser,rapid_feedback_generated_parser}.

These issues have motivated a long line of research into \emph{structure editors}, i.e., 
program editors where every edit state corresponds to a program structure \cite{cornell}.
Structure editors limit unstructured text editing to within well-formed structures and 
otherwise rely on operations that create and manipulate structural components.
In so doing, they avoid classes of syntax errors that may otherwise arise in plain text. This 
has proven useful for teaching children how to program, as demonstrated by the popularity of 
the structure editor Scratch \cite{scratch}. 

Recent work shows structure editing can support additional powerful advantages. The Jetbrains MPS language workbench uses a structure editor to enable clean composition of domain-specific languages as well as end-user-friendly graphical notations \cite{lessons_learned_mps}. Meanwhile, the functional programming language and environment \Hazel uses structure editing to enforce \emph{semantic} validity. Uniquely, \Hazel's type-aware edit actions and execution semantics for incomplete programs ensure that every reachable edit state is not only syntactically well-formed, but also statically and dynamically well-defined \cite{hazelnut,hazelnut_live}.

Despite all these advantages, structure editors have not achieved widespread adoption. They do not integrate well with existing toolchains built for the plain text format \cite{towards_user_friendly_projectional_editors}, and they are known for usability issues such as being hard to learn \cite{towards_user_friendly_projectional_editors,efficiency_of_projectional_editing} and scaling poorly to large programs \cite{blocks_at_your_fingertips}. In this paper, we focus our attention on the latter problem of usability.

We present the structure editor design of \Hazel. Our design improves on prior work by incorporating a novel \emph{node staging} mode that resolves ambiguous user intent when wrapping and unwrapping parent nodes around their children. 

\parahead{Paper Outline} We begin in Sec.~\ref{sec:related-work} by reviewing prior work on improving the usability of structure editors. This review motivates our design principles, which we state in Sec.~\ref{sec:design} followed by an example-driven overview of \Hazel's structure editor. Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion} describes future work and concludes.

\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related-work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item prior work on improving usability for inputting sequences of infix operators
  	\begin{itemize}
  		\item early structure editors like Cornell Synthesizer \cite{cornell} stepped around issue of infix operator sequences by resorting to text editing at leaves
  		\item other editors leverage a form of online precedence parsing to restructure the tree as needed
  	\end{itemize}
	\item comparatively, little innovation on interface for complex node construction and removal, that is, creating a new node that wraps around existing code, and removing a node while preserving or moving its children
		\begin{itemize}
			\item we believe interface for such operations in today's structure editors is key contributor to users' negative perceptions of structure editing
		\end{itemize}
	\item in a controlled experiment comparing user efficiency for MPS vs a text editor \cite{efficiency_of_projectional_editing}, Berger et al.~observe that novice users of structure editors perceive selection as inaccurate compared to other operations, and that \emph{both} novice and proficient users of structure editors perceive deletion as inaccurate compared to other operations.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item responses to a post-survey questionnaire reveal that structure editor users felt that they often deleted more than they expected, motivating our desire for a better interface for complex deletions
		\end{itemize}
	\item meanwhile, selection is essential for node construction in existing structure editors
		\begin{itemize}
			\item either the user must select a child node before applying a construction operation or the user must create the node and then select and move existing nodes into it
			\item thus, usability issues for selection affect node construction as well
		\end{itemize}
	\item additionally, we conjecture that node construction is awkward for novice users of structure editors because it inverts the usual order of operations when constructing nodes in text editors

\section{Design} \label{sec:design}

\subsection{Principles}

(WIP list)
\begin{itemize}
\item Users should be able to hold Backspace/Delete to delete everything before/after the cursor.
\item Users should be able to perform arbitrary deletions.
\item Deletions should be clearly indicated before they happen.
\item Users should be able to choose the node to construct before choosing its children.
\item Users should never have to follow two moving parts.
\end{itemize}

guided by overall text like experience, you want to operate on a tree like structure but enable linear operations as suggested by the layout, doesn't preclude tree operations or tree affordances/signifiers
\begin{itemize}
\item text-like cursor, single point of focus, differs from POPL 17 paper
\item deletion
\item operator sequences
\item selection model + cut/copy
\item line items (linearing tree)
\item keywords
\item tabbing between holes
\item cursor inspector, what is highlighted under the cursor, what is the mapping between text cursor and semantic cursor
\item transitory edit mode
\item shifting parentheses/delimiters (mark shift points, highlight points with least errors (maybe a single highlighted suggestion to minimize clutter)?)
\item maybe swapping
\item maybe mention inlining context inspector, put live values in side of code
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Example}

We now provide an example-driven overview of \Hazel's editing mechanics.
We walk through how one might implement in \Hazel the function \texttt{str\_of\_list},
which takes a list of numbers and returns its string representation. We
elide most steps and focus on a few interesting edit transitions. We refer
back to our design principles as they are demonstrated concretely.

In the rest of this section, each consecutive pair of programs connected
visually by a line represents a single edit transition. Text between the
start and end state of each edit describes the edit and relevant features of
\Hazel. Elided steps are denoted by ellipses between pairs of programs.
%\todo{add mention of cursor inspector, other editor services we are omitting
%to focus on editing mechanics}

	We have triggered \emph{node staging} mode. \Hazel has detected
	ambiguity in our intent: should the \texttt{case} expression be part of

	or should it remain in the subsequent body expression? Such ambiguities
	can be reduced to ambiguity in where to place a syntactic delimiter
	of the node being constructed. In this case, the delimiter in question is
	\texttt{in} on Line 3. In node staging mode, the left and right
	keys cycle through viable placements of the delimiter in question.
	We want the \texttt{case} expression to be in the defining expression,
	i.e., we want the \texttt{in} delimiter to come after the \texttt{case}
	expression, so we press right to see the next viable position.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This summer, we will finish our implementation and evaluate our design via a user study.
We plan on recruiting participants from the Recurse Center, a self-directed educational retreat for programmers in New York City. We plan on having users walk through a variety of implementation and refactoring exercises within \Hazel, then qualitatively analyzing their edit logs and subjective responses.
